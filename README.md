# Vision '23
Bienvenue freshers,

Welcome to Vision-2023! Vision is an Image-Processing based Robotics Competition being organised by the Robotics Club, IIT (BHU), Varanasi to facilitate learning about different components of image processing and its application in building robots capable of autonomous movement. This repo holds the first problem statement of the event and its arena. The Arena is in the form of an OpenAI gym and runs on python libraries like Pybullet and OpenCV.

## Competition Description


The vision aspect of the competition focuses on developing a robot's ability to perceive its environment and make decisions based on visual information.
This repository holds the official arena for the event which will be used for evaluation of the submissions by the participants. 

The complete problem statement can be found below :
#PS LINK

Complete the solution code to detect the target and navigate to the goal, making use of Pybullet simulation and computer vision.



## Prerequisites

Your Enthusiasm!!!!


## Getting Started
To get started, follow the steps below:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
` git clone https://github.com/Robotics-Club-IIT-BHU/VISION-23.git `

Familiarise yourself with the competition guidelines and requirements.

Program your robot to detect the humanoid using computer vision.
Test your robot in a Pybullet environment.
Submit your code.



## Competition Guidelines

The competition will take place solely in a virtual environment-Pybullet.

You are encouraged to use open-source libraries for computer vision and robotics for any help you need.

The judges will evaluate the participants based on the functionality of their robot, the quality of their code.


## Submitting Your Project

We will be floating a form link soon. Upload your code as well as the video on the form itself.


## Resources
Here are some resources to help you get started:

OpenCV - an open-source computer vision library.

Good luck, and have fun! If you have any questions, feel free to approach your mentors.
